This is the repository of debian/ folders to build Debian and Ubuntu
packages for MATE, for development and testing purposes.

You can use debian/ folders with standard tarballs from:
    * https://pub.kramaos.org/releases/1.21/
    * https://pub.kramaos.org/releases/themes/3.22/

Or you can build from git master branches. In this case you need to have
these folders:

    ~/kosmos/debian-packages      (this repo)

    ~/kosmos/atril
    ~/kosmos/caja                 (kosmos packages)
    ~/kosmos/kosmos-panel

Launch build.py from ~/kosmos. Example:

    user@test ~/kosmos/ $ debian-packages/build.py caja

The source folder will be copied on /tmp/, debian folder will be hacked
to build without tarball, and result .debs will be put on ~/kosmos.
